# Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user input. The system is built using Streamlit and a movie database. The user can enter their favorite movie and the system suggests similar movies based on the genre, director, and rating.
## Novelty of this project:
1. Personalized movie recommendations: A movie recommendation system can suggest movies based on a user's viewing history and preferences. This can help users discover new movies that they may not have otherwise known about.

2. Enhanced user engagement: By providing relevant and personalized movie recommendations, a recommendation system can increase user engagement with a movie platform, leading to increased customer retention and loyalty.

3. Improved content discovery: A movie recommendation system can help users find movies they are interested in, even if they don't know exactly what they are looking for. This can help users save time and make more informed decisions when choosing which movies to watch.

4. Increased revenue: By suggesting movies that are more likely to be of interest to users, a recommendation system can increase revenue for movie platforms. This can be achieved through increased customer retention, higher engagement, and increased sales of movies.

5. Better data analysis: A movie recommendation system can provide insights into user preferences and behavior, which can be used to improve the overall movie platform. This can include optimizing content selection and improving the user experience.
